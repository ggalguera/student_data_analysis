# student_data_analysis
## Report Findings
  The variation between the smallest and the largest schools is high, while the smallest school has 171 the largest school has 2038 students.
  Cleaning and understanding the data is very important to have reliable results
  Working with the group function is more like working with objects than with data
## Aditional Analysis
  Aditional analysis can be see if the budget has an impact on grades (I did the analisys but R-Squared is super low)
  An analysis of reading_score by school_type and grade also could be useful.
## Understanding of the performed analysis
  We used functions of the pandas library to prepare and analyze students data from different schools
